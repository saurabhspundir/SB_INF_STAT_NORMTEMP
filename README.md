# SB_INF_STAT_NORMTEMP
This repo contains the code with solution for exercise given for Inferential statistics. This is part of Springboard DS career track course.
 </br></br>
<b>Task Description </b></br></br>
In this exercise, you will analyze a dataset of human body temperatures and employ the concepts of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance. Data and instructions are in the Jupyter notebook above.
</br>
This contains a file with people temprature observation in  human_body_temperature.csv. This file contains 150 independent tempratue and heart beat observation fro both male and female.</br></br>

Using data in file 'data/human_body_temperature.csv' following needs to find out.</br>
<p>Answer the following questions <b>in this notebook below and submit to your Github account</b>.</p> 

<ol>
<li>  Is the distribution of body temperatures normal? 
    <ul>
    <li> Although this is not a requirement for CLT to hold (read CLT carefully), it gives us some peace of mind that the population may also be normally distributed if we assume that this sample is representative of the population.
    </ul>
<li>  Is the sample size large? Are the observations independent?
    <ul>
    <li> Remember that this is a condition for the CLT, and hence the statistical tests we are using, to apply.
    </ul>
<li>  Is the true population mean really 98.6 degrees F?
    <ul>
    <li> Would you use a one-sample or two-sample test? Why?
    <li> In this situation, is it appropriate to use the $t$ or $z$ statistic? 
    <li> Now try using the other test. How is the result be different? Why?
    </ul>
<li>  At what temperature should we consider someone's temperature to be "abnormal"?
    <ul>
    <li> Start by computing the margin of error and confidence interval.
    </ul>
<li>  Is there a significant difference between males and females in normal temperature?
    <ul>
    <li> What test did you use and why?
    <li> Write a story with your conclusion in the context of the original problem.
    </ul>
</ol>

<b>The task contains following steps.</b></br>
1.	Reading data provided from csv file. </br>
2.	Create data frame for the data</br>
3.	Apply the infenertial statiscs skills to get answers</br>
